<h1> MyTrello </h1>

<p align = "left"> The idea of this app is to enhance productivity in workplaces by providing a platform in which every user can see their tasks and know exactly what to do without any other meetings. The managers assign tasks to the employees and, when the task is done, the employees just have to press the finish button corresponding to the task.  </p>
